# Version: 1.0.1

## A simple washing machine control program in C++:
## This program allows the user to control the mode and setting of the washing machine. The user can choose from three modes (delicate, normal, and heavy duty) and three settings (low, medium, and high). The program loops until the user chooses to turn off the washing machine. This program is almost identical to the previous one, except that it uses C++'s std::cout and std::cin for input and output instead of C's printf() and `scanf

## Here's the entire washing machine control program in optimized C++:
## This version of the program uses enums to represent the different modes and settings,
## and uses a switch statement to parse the user input. It also uses a do-while loop to check the mode at the end of each iteration.
## This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
